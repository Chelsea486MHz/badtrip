# BADTRIP

Intrusion detection based on OpenSCAP, AIDE, and the Trusted Platform Module

## How it works

badtrip, once installed, will check your system for intrusions at a configurable interval of time. It performs AIDE database checks to ensure file integrity, as well as OpenSCAP compliance tests and can make use of a Trusted Platform Module to make sure it is itself not tampered with prior to execution.

By default, BADTRIP is configured to work with the [SEALFAIL](https://github.com/SEALFAIL) operating system.
